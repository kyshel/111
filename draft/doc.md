- tumor is a part in the pic, not the whold image can treat like classical image
need some technique that focus on the tumor

search medical info

try diff dim 
- add all pix and then scale them 
pie ok 


# p1

# p9
- png 3 channel sample, view the tumor range 
- try directly crop little 
- chop edges very high
- unify all the pic direction

- wirte a loader that can multithread load, and multithread save , and has progress bar
